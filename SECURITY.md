## Supported Versions

This table shows the currently supported versions of our project and whether they receive security updates:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and encourage responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us via email.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at [admin@arefinink.com](mailto:admin@arefinink.com). We request that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to address it.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Your name and contact information (optional)

We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours and will strive to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

## Response Time

Our team will evaluate and respond to security reports promptly. We aim to provide an initial assessment within 48 hours of receiving a report.

## Security Updates

If a reported vulnerability is confirmed, we will take the following steps:
- Evaluate the impact and severity of the vulnerability
- Develop and release patches or updates as necessary
- Coordinate the disclosure of the vulnerability and solution

We prioritize the security of our users and will make every effort to deliver timely security updates to supported versions.

## End-of-Life Policy

When a version reaches its end-of-life (EOL) as indicated in the supported versions table, we will no longer provide security updates for that version. We encourage users to upgrade to a supported version to receive the latest security patches.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the work of security researchers in helping to keep our project safe. We adhere to responsible disclosure practices and will credit individuals who report valid security issues.
